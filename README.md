great-APIs
==========

This repository is a placeholder for everything that takes to build great APIs. By everything I mean everything. I envision it to have varied content as it progresses through time - code, presentations, etc. 

version 1.0
==========
This first version consists of a slide deck explaining the REST architecture style (including its constraints, myths and some facts). The deck is created using Reveal.js and can be seen at http://fsequeir.github.io/great-APIs. Comments, suggestions, questions are welcome.
